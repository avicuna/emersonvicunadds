                1: `Dental radiograph, dental cleaning plan, plan to restore the health of the gums:
                    regular/deep cleaning, evaluate for dental cavities, replace any missing teeth.`,
                2: `The most important ingredient to look for when choosing toothpaste is fluoride. 
                    Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral. Its use has been instrumental in the 
                    dramatic drop in tooth decay and cavity occurrence that has taken place over the 
                    past 50 years. Bacteria in your mouth feed on sugars and starches that remain on 
                    your teeth after eating. Fluoride helps protect your teeth from the acid that is 
                    released when this happens. It does this in two ways. First, fluoride makes your 
                    tooth enamel stronger and less likely to suffer acid damage. Second, it can 
                    reverse the early stages of acid damage by solidifying areas that have started to 
                    decay.`,
                3: `Plaque develops when foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches), such as 
                    milk, soft drinks, raisins, cakes, or candy are frequently left on the teeth. 
                    Bacteria that live in the mouth thrive on these foods, producing acids as a result. 
                    Over a period of time, these acids destroy tooth enamel, resulting in tooth decay. 
                    Plaque can also develop on the tooth roots under the gum and cause breakdown of the 
                    bone supporting the tooth.`,
                4: `Flossing reduces the number of bacteria in your mouth. There are millions of these 
                    microscopic creatures feeding on food particles left on your teeth. These bacteria 
                    live in plaque which can be removed by flossing. Brushing your teeth gets rid of 
                    some of the bacteria in your mouth. Flossing gets rid of the bacteria the toothbrush 
                    can't get to. That's the bacteria hiding in the tiny spaces between your teeth. If 
                    you do not floss, you allow plaque to remain between your teeth. Eventually it 
                    hardens into tartar. Plaque can be removed by brushing. Only the dentist can remove 
                    tartar.`,
                5: `Make it fun! If you are enthusiastic about brushing your teeth, your children will also 
                    be enthusiastic. Children want to do the things their parents do. If your children see 
                    you brushing your teeth and displaying good dental habits, they will follow. Getting your 
                    children to brush starts with taking them to the dentist at an early age.`,
                6: {
                    1: `Always spend two to three minutes brushing your teeth. It takes that long to get rid of the 
                        bacteria that destroy tooth enamel. Do not brush too hard. It takes very little pressure to 
                        remove bacteria and plaque. Floss at least once a day. Flossing is the only way to get bacteria 
                        from between your teeth.`,
                    2: `Watch the sugar you eat. There is sugar in candy, fruits, crackers and chips. These are the 
                        foods that the bacteria in your mouth like best. Be mindful of foods like raisins and peanut 
                        butter that stick to your teeth. They can provide a constant supply for the bacteria eating 
                        into your teeth. Try to minimize the times during the day when sweet items are eaten and brush 
                        your teeth afterwards.`,
                    3: `If you cannot brush after a meal, rinse your mouth with water - which can help to remove food 
                        from your teeth. Chewing sugarless gum after a meal can also help. Chewing deskulates the flow 
                        of your saliva which acts as a natural plaque-fighting substance. And do not forget your regular 
                        dental visits. Good dental habits will go a long way toward a no-cavity visit.`
                },
                7: `If a manual toothbrush is used for the appropriate amount of time, and done with proper technique, 
                    it can perform just as well as a powered toothbrush. But many people don’t brush for the recommended 
                    two to three minutes. Children are also good candidates for powered brushes as their brushing habits 
                    tend to be less than optimal. While everyone certainly does not need an electric toothbrush, in many 
                    instances they can be beneficial. Ask your dentist if you have any questions about which brush is best 
                    for you.`,
                8: `While bad breath (or “halitosis”) can be linked to numerous systemic diseases, the majority of bad breath 
                    originates in the mouth. A dry mouth or a low salivary flow can also influence bad odor. There are two main 
                    goals in the management of bad breath. First, controlling the bacteria that produce the sulfur compounds and 
                    second, to neutralize the sulfur compounds that are produced.`,

            answers: {
                1: `Most people need to visit their dentist for a regular hygiene visit twice a year, or
                    once every six months. There are exceptions to this rule, however. If you have gum disease,
                    or a history of gum disease, your dentist may recommend more frequent visits. Another
                    reason you may need to see the dentist more frequently is if you are undergoing orthodontic
                    treatment. The bottom line is that you need to at least see the dentist twice a year and
                    you need to comply if it is recommended that you make those visits more frequent.`,
                2: `Dental x-rays are very safe. The amount of radiation that a dental x-ray produces
                    is about the same as you would receive from a cross country airplane ride.
                    Radiation is measured in millirems and one dental x-ray has only .5 millirems.`,
                3: `A common misconception is that dental restorations last forever but unfortunately this is
                    rarely true. With time dental restorations may break down or become loose, allowing decay
                    to enter the area around the restoration and become problematic. Although you can’t expect
                    your fillings, bridges, and crowns to last forever, you can do your part to make them last
                    as long as possible. Maintain great oral hygiene and visit your dentist regularly to keep
                    those restorations in great condition for as long as possible.`,
                4: `Sensitivity toothpaste, which contains strontium chloride or potassium nitrate are very effective 
                    in treating sensitive teeth. After a few weeks of use, you may notice a decrease in sensitivity. 
                    Highly acidic foods such as oranges, grapefruits and lemons, as well as tea and soda can increase 
                    tooth sensitivity, and work against sensitivity toothpaste. If you do not get relief by brushing 
                    gently and using desensitizing toothpaste, see your dentist. There are special compounds that can 
                    be applied in-office to the roots of your tooth to reduce - if not eliminate - the sensitivity. 
                    High-fluoride containing home care products can also be recommended to help reduce tooth sensitivity.`,
                5: `The main cause of bleeding gums is the buildup of plaque at the gum line. This will lead to a condition 
                    called gingivitis, or inflamed gums. Plaque that is not removed will harden into tartar. This will lead 
                    to increased bleeding and a more advanced form of gum and bone disease known as periodontitis. Bleeding 
                    gums can happen for a number of reasons, from gingivitis to a side effect of pregnancy. Changing your 
                    oral care routine can also make your gums bleed. We recommend brushing and flossing regularly and getting 
                    your semiannual dental visit in to stop your gums from bleeding. Certain medicines also increase the likelihood 
                    that your gums will bleed. If changing your oral care habits, adjusting your medications, and maintaining a healthy 
                    diet doesn’t help your gums stop bleeding, your next step should be to make a dental appointment.`
                ,
                6: `Chemotherapy and Radiation can cause a number of problems in the mouth, some of which might include: mouth sores, 
                    infections, dry mouth, bleeding of the gums and lining of the mouth and general soreness and pain of the mouth. It 
                    can be harder to control these things while undergoing treatment as the immune system is generally compromised as a 
                    result of the treatment. There are some special mouth rinses that can be prescribed to help with discomfort during 
                    treatment. It is very important to see your dentist before treatment begins and then to continue with recommended 
                    follow-up care. These treatments can cause dry mouth, and recommendations might be made for additional care both 
                    in-office and at home.`,
                7: `Visits to the dentist include more than just "checking teeth." While patients who wear dentures no longer have to 
                    worry about dental decay, they may have concerns with ill fitting appliances or mouth sores to name a few. Annual 
                    visits to the dentist (or sooner if soreness is present) is recommended. During these visits, an oral cancer screening 
                    and head and neck exam will be performed as well as an evaluation of the fit or need for replacement of the existing 
                    appliances. Regular visits can help you to avoid more complicated problems down the road.`,
                8: {
                    1: `Tooth decay, also known as a cavity, occurs when bacteria living in your mouth make acid that begins to eat away at 
                        your teeth. Untreated tooth decay may cause infection, extreme pain and the loss of tooth. The decay process begins 
                        with the unnoticeable damage to the enamel of your teeth and then steadily progresses to deeper layers of the tooth, 
                        eventually leading to the pulp. The pulp of your teeth contains highly-sensitive blood vessels and nerves. Proper oral 
                        hygiene includes brushing your teeth regularly, flossing regularly and brushing your tongue. If possible brush your 
                        teeth twice a day – morning and night.`,
                    2: `The top causes of tooth decay include: Poor Oral Hygiene, Improper Nutrition, Sugary Foods, Acidic Foods and Drinks, 
                        Dry Mouth Issues, Tooth Grinding, Genetics, Age and Avoiding the Dentist.`

                    1: `To relieve your dry mouth try chewing sugar-free gum or suck on sugar-free hard candies to stimulate the flow of saliva. 
                        For some people sugar-free gum or sugar-free candies may cause diarrhea or cramps if consumed in large amounts.`,
                    2: `You can also try limiting your caffeine intake because caffeine can make your mouth drier. Also don’t 
                        use mouthwashes that contain alcohol because they can be drying. You could stop all tobacco use if you smoke or chew tobacco. 
                        Sipping water regularly can help (and that’s a healthy thing to do) to keep the saliva flowing and has shown to relieve the 
                        symptom. There are also some over the counter products made by Biotene that have helped many of our patients with their dry

                1: `The period when early hard teeth are growing is a major event in the life of an infant,
                    and it can be difficult. The eruption of teeth causes inflammation, which leads to congestion,
                    drooling, and discomfort. While the average time for the appearance of the first teeth is
                    between five and seven months of age, there is a wide range before and after this that can
                    still be considered “normal”. The teeth might come in as early as one month of age, or they
                    may erupt when the child is one-and-a-half years old. Generally the lower front teeth come
                    in first, and girls’ teeth typically erupt earlier than boys.`,
                2: `In order to prevent dental problems, your child should see a pediatric dentist between 6-9 months for a visual examination,
                    or no later their first birthday.`,
                3: `If baby teeth become diseased or decayed it can lead to pain and infection. It can also be difficult for children
                    to eat a well-balanced meal with a mouth full of cavities. Untreated cavities also increase the amount of decay
                    causing bacteria in the mouth. As permanent teeth erupt, they are at increased risk for developing cavities because
                    of the higher bacteria count. Baby teeth also hold space in the mouth for the erupting permanent teeth. If the baby
                    teeth become decayed or are taken out too early, the permanent teeth often become crowded and will likely need braces
                    to straighten in the future.`,
                4: `The American Dental Association recommends that kids receive dental sealants as soon as their adult teeth
                    erupt. Dental sealants are a quick, easy, and relatively cheap solution for preventing cavities. They are
                    thin coatings applied to the biting surfaces that help prevent bacteria and other debris from getting into
                    the deep crevices on the teeth. Young children are great candidates for preventative measures like sealants
                    because in many cases, decay has not set in. Children’s teeth tend to benefit more from sealants because
                    these pits and groves tend to be deeper and less calcified then they are in adults. Kids are notoriously
                    bad brushers and tend to ignore the problem areas in the back of the mouth that lead to cavities and decay.`,
                5: `Pregnancy and dental work questions are common for expecting moms. Preventive dental cleanings and annual exams during
                    pregnancy are not only safe, but are recommended. The rise in hormone levels during pregnancy causes the gums to swell,
                    bleed, and trap food causing increased irritation to your gums. Preventive dental work while pregnant is essential to
                    avoid oral infections such as gum disease, which has been linked to preterm birth.`

            answers: {
                1: `There are several different options available to change the shape of your teeth. 
                    You can choose to make your teeth look longer, close spaces between your teeth 
                    or repair a chipped or cracked tooth. Among the options are bonding, crowns, 
                    veneers, and re-contouring.`,
                2: `If your tooth is broken, chipped, or fractured, see your dentist as soon as possible. 
                    Otherwise, your tooth could be damaged further or become infected, possibly causing 
                    you to end up losing the tooth.`,
                3: `Tooth discoloration may result from drinking coffee, tea, cola and red wine; or from smoking. 
                    The aging process also can stain and darken your teeth. Some options to consider when 
                    looking for whiter teeth include whitening toothpastes and in-office bleaching. Before deciding 
                    whether in-office bleaching is right for you, we conduct a comprehensive examination of your 
                    teeth and gums to ensure proper health, and talk with you about your oral hygiene and lifestyle 
                    habits to determine if you will benefit from whitening. This helps us agree on the whitening 
                    product or technique that’s best for you.`

                    1: `Time is your enemy when an accident or any trauma dislodges a tooth. First locate the tooth, 
                        or teeth, and determine if the tooth broke or if the entire tooth and root came out in one piece. 
                        Gather together the pieces you’ve found, and with warm water gently rinse off obvious dirt or 
                        debris. Avoid touching the root as much as possible. Place and transport the tooth in milk or in 
                        some of the person’s own saliva.`,
                    2: `Rush the injured person and tooth to the dental office. Ideally the tooth will be re-implanted. 
                        The tooth may also be splinted with a wire to the adjacent teeth for a period of time.`,
                    3: `If you cannot contact a dentist your nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Room may be able to help.`
                },
                2: {
                    1: `If you’re unable to reach your dentist, check the internet or yellow pages listings for a 
                        dentist or urgent care nearby. If you can’t reach any dentist, here are some helpful tips: `,
                    2: `If you have a toothache rinse your mouth with warm salt water. Gently brush and floss the area to remove any trapped food 
                        or debris. If you can take over the counter pain medications (such as Ibuprofen) they may help in 
                        soothing the pain. Topical gels (such as Orajel) can sometimes help, but usually only a little bit 
                        and for a minimal amount of time. Make arrangements to see your dentist even if the pain goes. Without 
                        proper care your condition could return or even worsen. (To make salt water rinse: mix 1 teaspoon table 
                        salt with 1 cup warm water).`,
                    3: `If your permanent (or temporary) crown comes off keep the area clean by rinsing with warm salt water rinses 
                        and by gently brushing the area if it is not too sensitive. Avoid leaving the crown out for more than a few 
                        days as teeth can shift, making it difficult or impossible to re-cement it at a later date. If the tooth is 
                        painful, denture cream or toothpaste can be placed inside the crown and it can be gently fit back into place.`
                },
                3: {
                    1: `When a tooth is lost, a whole series of events can begin to occur. Chewing on the affected side becomes more 
                        difficult and over time the remaining teeth can actually tilt and erupt into the open space.`,
                    2: `Depending on the location of the missing tooth, we would most likely recommend either a dental implant, a bridge, 
                        or a partial denture. All of these options have their benefits and drawbacks. If you would like more information 
                        we can schedule a consultation to go over the specifics of your case.`
